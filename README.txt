Introduction
============

*collective.addthis* is a simple Plone addon which brings `addthis.com`_ 
services to Plone pages under document actions.

There are few other similar addons for Plone (`collective.prettysociable`_,
`collective.plonebookmarklets`_ and `sc.social.bookmarks`_) which does same
job just fine. *collective.addthis* differentiates itself of it's alternatives by
actually using addthis.com service instead of implementing own version of same
functionality.
